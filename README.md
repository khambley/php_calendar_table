php_calendar_table
==================

Creates a calendar based on user's birthday, month and day, and current year. (O'Reilly School Project #11)
In this project, you'll create a calendar for the month in which your birthday falls for the current year. 

You should use date and time functions and a loop to create an html table that will display the calendar in the appropriate
format. The days of the week (Sunday through Saturday) should be used to label the seven columns of your calendar, and the dates for each day should be displayed in the appropriate table cell. 

In addition, the cell for your birthday should be distinctive in appearance from the other dates. For example, the date on which your birthday falls might be a different color, and the cell might display My Birthday!!! within it. 

Be sure to save and submit your PHP file.
